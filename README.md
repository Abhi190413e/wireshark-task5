# üîí Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis: Kali Linux Lab

This repository contains the results and analysis of a network traffic capture performed in a Kali Linux Virtual Machine, focusing on demonstrating the identification and inspection of common network protocols.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

## üìù Network Capture Analysis Summary (Privacy Enhanced)

**Capture File:** `w-traffic.pcap`
**Total Packets Captured:** 848

### Network Identification
* **Source IP (Internal VM - Hidden):** `X.X.X.X` (Replaced the private IP for security)
* **Public/External IPs Observed:** `8.8.8.8` (Google DNS), `142.250.202.35` (Google-owned IP), `114.114.114.114` (Public DNS).

### Protocols Identified and Analyzed (Minimum 3)

The capture clearly demonstrates communication using three essential network protocols: **TCP**, **ICMP**, and **DNS**.

#### 1. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) üåê

| Detail | Packet Example (Frame 79) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Source IP:Port** | `X.X.X.X:34722` |
| **Destination IP:Port** | `142.250.202.35:80` |
| **Protocol Purpose** | Provides reliable, ordered delivery of data, managing connection setup and teardown. |
| **Info/Flags** | **[FIN, ACK]** Seq=1 Win=502 Len=0 |
| **Analysis** | This packet shows the **FIN (Finish)** flag, indicating the VM is actively closing its side of the connection to the external web server on port 80 (HTTP). |

#### 2. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) üì°

| Detail | Packet Example (Frame 366) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Source IP** | `X.X.X.X` |
| **Destination IP** | `8.8.8.8` |
| **Protocol Purpose** | Used for diagnostics and error reporting, generated by the `ping` command. |
| **Info/Type** | **ICMP Echo (ping) request** Id=0x0003, seq=1/256 |
| **Analysis** | This packet is the initial **Echo Request** sent from the internal host to `8.8.8.8`, confirming the host was performing a basic connectivity test. A corresponding **Echo Reply** would complete the ICMP exchange. |

#### 3. DNS (Domain Name System) üîé

| Detail | Packet Example (Frame 26) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Source IP** | `X.X.X.X` |
| **Destination IP** | `114.114.114.114` |
| **Protocol Purpose** | Translates domain names into numerical IP addresses. |
| **Info/Query** | **Standard query 0x0f1d A 1.yting.com** |
| **Analysis** | The host is querying the DNS server for the **A record** (IPv4 address) of the domain `1.yting.com`, a necessary step before connecting to any service on that domain. |

## üí° Overall Findings

The traffic capture is characteristic of a host performing typical network activities:

1.  **Web Interaction:** The TCP segments and the presence of OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) traffic suggest the VM was accessing secured or standard web resources.
2.  **Basic Connectivity:** The ICMP packets confirm the machine's ability to reach external networks and hosts.
3.  **Client Workflow:** The flow often starts with **DNS** (getting an IP), proceeds to **TCP** (establishing a connection), and then transfers application data (like HTTP or OCSP), demonstrating the sequential nature of the Internet Protocol Suite.
